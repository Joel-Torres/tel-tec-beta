				<h4><small><a href="https://leadersinlife.org/" target="_blank">Leaders in Life</a></small></h4>
				<p>In 1998, local businessman Morgan Clayton approached the Kern County Network for Children
					about establishing a premier youth conference in Kern County.
					Planning began in the fall of 1999 with about 35 students who brainstormed and developed the
					first conference held in February 2000.
					In 20 years of the conference, approximately 40,000 students and adult chaperones have
					attended.</p>
                <br>
                <p>About 1,340 students have participated on the planning committee over 20 years.
					Selected students are invited to also serve on the Executive Committee and receive additional
					leadership development through the California Association of Student Councils (see
					<a href="https://www.casc.net/" target="_blank">www.casc.net</a> – a nationally recognized program for training youth leaders for over 60 years).
					Student planners, guided by adult advisors, attend monthly general planning meetings; each
					student also participates in one of four working subcommittees: Workshops & Speakers,
					Marketing & Fundraising, Resource Fair and Venue & Logistics.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Conference has been sustained through the community outreach and the fund raising
					efforts of Morgan Clayton and the Kern County Superintendent of Schools and by the active
					involvement of youth on the planning committee.</p>

				<h4><small>iLEAD /iChoose program</small></h4>
				<p>The iLEAD /iChoose program consists of 16 lessons spread out
					over four units with the goal of helping teenagers learn leadership values
					and teaching them how to apply them to their own lives. iChoose was
					designed to provide students with an environment for leadership values to
					be introduced,practiced, and shared. Because many of today’s teenagers
					equate leadership with a position, abuse of power,bribery, and corruption,
					few young people have a healthy correct understanding of what leadership
					is and how they can apply it to their lives and the lives of others.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As a member of the John C. Maxwell team, I provide this program to help
					reverse the negative portrayal of leadership by offering a desirable portrait
					of leadership based on values that can be applicable to a student’s life-
					values, that teenagers can admire,implement, and choose to aspire to for a
					more positive and sustained style of leadership.</p>
				<br>
				
				<h5>Objectives</h5>
				<p>This program has been designed to help students accomplish five goals:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Identify with the 16 values of leadership</li>
					<li>Take ownership of their choices</li>
					<li>Practice leadership values and develop those skills</li>
					<li>Evaluate themselves with their applied knowledge</li>
					<li>Take turns guiding small group discussions</li>
				</ol>

				<h5>Measures of Success/Outcomes</h5>

				<ul>
					<li>Increase in discussion and participation in leadership development.</li>
					<li>Noticeably stronger relationships between group members, and an
						increase in community strength.</li>
					<li>Greater awareness of self,behaviors,communications style,strengths,
						and skills.</li>
					<li>Greater awareness of leadership activities,goals,roles, and initiatives.</li>
				</ul>
